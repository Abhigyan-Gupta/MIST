# Problem
Files are all around you. Like candy wrappers, there'll eventually be too many of them. In this level, we'll learn to clean up!

In Linux, you remove files with the `rm` command, as so:

`hacker@dojo:~$ touch PWN`

`hacker@dojo:~$ touch COLLEGE`

`hacker@dojo:~$ ls`

`COLLEGE     PWN`

`hacker@dojo:~$ rm PWN`

`hacker@dojo:~$ ls`

`COLLEGE`

`hacker@dojo:~$`

Let's practice. This challenge will create a `delete_me` file in your home directory! Delete it, then run `/challenge/check`, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!
# Execution
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me

hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check

Excellent removal. Here is your reward:

pwn.college{UITSxzQ-jO4rfrFJMyQl43NQpbw.QX2kDM1wCM3MjMwEzW}

hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ 
# Flag
pwn.college{UITSxzQ-jO4rfrFJMyQl43NQpbw.QX2kDM1wCM3MjMwEzW}
