# Problem
In the last level, you did `cat flag` to read the flag out of your home directory! You can, of course, specify cat's arguments as absolute paths:

`hacker@dojo:~$ cat /challenge/DESCRIPTION.md`

...

In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with `cat` at its absolute path: `/flag`.

FUN FACT: /flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college, but unlike in this challenge, you typically can't access that file directly.
# Execution
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag

pwn.college{Q1M1ebnmiFO6AAiFB7G3Bu0ZQzw.QX5ETO0wCM3MjMwEzW}
