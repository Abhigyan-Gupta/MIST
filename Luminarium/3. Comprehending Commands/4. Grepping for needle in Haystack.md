# Problem
Sometimes, the files that you might cat out are too big. Luckily, we have the `grep` command to search for the contents we need! We'll learn it in this challenge.

There are many ways to grep, and we'll learn on way here:

`hacker@dojo:~$ grep SEARCH_STRING /path/to/file`

Invoked like this, grep will search the file for lines of text containing `SEARCH_STRING` and print them to the console.

In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the `/challenge/data.txt` file. Grep it for the flag!

HINT: The flag always starts with the text pwn.college.
