# Problem 
Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by *touching it* with the touch command:

`hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp`

`hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls`

`hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile`

`hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls`

`pwnfile`

`hacker@dojo:/tmp$`

It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

# Execution
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ cd /tmp

hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch pwn

hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch college

hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ cd

hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run

Success! Here is your flag:

pwn.college{EMCz_sl0hbYItE5HNfTTk7Ukqgi.QXwMDO0wCM3MjMwEzW}

hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ 

# Flag
pwn.college{EMCz_sl0hbYItE5HNfTTk7Ukqgi.QXwMDO0wCM3MjMwEzW}
