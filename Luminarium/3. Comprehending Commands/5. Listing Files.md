# Problem
So far, we've told you which files to interact with. But directories can have lots of files (and other directories) inside them, and we won't always be here to tell you their names. You'll need to learn to list their contents using the `ls` command!

`ls` will list files in all the directories provided to it as arguments, and in the current directory if no arguments are provided. Observe:

hacker@dojo:~$ ls /challenge
run

hacker@dojo:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates
Documents  Music      Public    Videos

hacker@dojo:~$ ls /home/hacker

Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates
Documents  Music      Public    Videos

hacker@dojo:~$

In this challenge, we've named /challenge/run with some random name! List the files in /challenge to find it.

# Execution
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge

26754-renamed-run-20255  DESCRIPTION.md

hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/26754-renamed-run-20255

Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
