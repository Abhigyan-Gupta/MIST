# Problem
You can specify all sorts of paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice some more with `cat`. In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with cd, so no `cat flag` for you. You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.
# Execution
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /usr/include/glib-2.0/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into 
that directory!
