# Problem
 In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so: 

`hacker@dojo:~$ whoami`

`hacker`

`hacker@dojo:~$`

Here, the user executed the `whoami` command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: `hello` is different from `HELLO`.

# Execution 
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami

hacker

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello

Success! Here is your flag:

pwn.college{geGRV3ojzFXVXyoD0dxRcMT3AUq.QX3YjM1wCM3MjMwEzW}

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 

# Flag
pwn.college{geGRV3ojzFXVXyoD0dxRcMT3AUq.QX3YjM1wCM3MjMwEzW}
