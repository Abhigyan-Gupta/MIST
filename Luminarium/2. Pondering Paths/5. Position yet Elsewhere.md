# Problem 
The Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files. You can navigate around directories by using the cd (change directory) command and passing a path to it as an argument, as so:

`hacker@dojo:~$ cd /some/new/directory`

`hacker@dojo:/some/new/directory$ cd /some/new/directory`

This affects the "current working directory" of your process (in this case, the bash shell). Each process has a directory in which it's currently hanging out. The reasons for this will become clear later in the module.

As an aside, now you can see what the `~` was in the prompt! It shows the current path that your shell is located at.

This challenge will require you to execute the `/challenge/run` program from a specific path (which it will tell you). You'll need to `cd` to that directory before rerunning the challenge program. Good luck!

# Execution 
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run

Incorrect...

You are not currently in the /sys directory.

Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.

hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /sys

hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/sys$ /challenge/run

Correct!!!

/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
